## 📦 AtliQ Mart - Supply Chain FMCG Dashboard

# 🚀 Project Overview

AtliQ Mart, an FMCG distributor in Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara, plans to expand into Tier-1 cities within the next two years. However, several key customers did not renew their contracts due to service issues—delayed or incomplete deliveries of essential products.

This Power BI dashboard provides insights into supply chain efficiency, helping AtliQ Mart identify service gaps and optimize delivery performance.
